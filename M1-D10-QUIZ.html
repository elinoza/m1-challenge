        RULES:
        / The player must guess correctly a certain amount of questions
        / Each correct answer gives him one point
        / Answers could be “multiple” or “true/false”
        / At the end of the game, the user must know his total score

        QUESTIONS:

        HINTS:
        / Keep a global variable “score” for the score
        / Keep a variable “questionNumber” for the “question” the user is answering
        / When “questionNumber” is bigger then the available questions, present the score
        / Start working with the question saved in a variable
        / Start with the easier version and THEN implement the “EXTRAs”
        / Please debug everything / try it on the console to be sure of what to expect from your code

        EXTRA:

      //IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS TOGETHER:
      //HINT: for each question, create a container with the "question"
      //create a radio button https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio with, as option the both the correct answer and the incorrect answers
      //when EVERY question has an answer (google for how to get a value from a radio button with JS)
      //IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
      //Display first question with a title + radio button
      //when the user select the answer, pick the next question and
      //remove this from the page after added in a varible the users' choice.

      //HOW TO calculate the result
      //You can do it in 2 ways:
      //If you are presenting all questions together, just take all the radio buttons and check if the selected answer === correct_answer
      //If you are presenting one question at a time,
      // just add one point or not to the user score if the selected answer === correct_answer
